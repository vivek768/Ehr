The adoption and standardization of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) play a pivotal role in transforming traditional healthcare systems into more efficient, accessible, and patient-centric models. This study was centered around understanding global trends in EHR implementation and identifying a framework that could best suit India's unique healthcare landscape. By surveying a diverse range of countries—including technologically advanced nations like the United States and members of the European Union, as well as transitional systems such as China and Japan—this research constructed a comparative perspective grounded in six core parameters: governance structure, interoperability standards, level of adoption, data privacy regulations, digital literacy, and private sector integration.

Through the application of machine learning—specifically K-Means clustering—countries were grouped into three clusters representing different levels of EHR system maturity: advanced, transitional, and emerging. India was deliberately excluded during the model training phase to allow for an unbiased post-evaluation. When India’s profile was tested against the trained model, it was assigned to the transitional cluster. This result not only confirms the current status of India's digital health ecosystem but also reinforces the direction of national initiatives like the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM), which aim to create a unified health information infrastructure. However, India's placement in the transitional cluster also highlights critical gaps that must be addressed to move toward an advanced level—such as strengthening privacy legislation, improving digital literacy among healthcare professionals, and ensuring seamless interoperability across public and private sectors.

The outcome of this study is not just a categorization, but a strategic tool. It allows policymakers to benchmark India’s progress, identify specific areas for improvement, and learn from structurally similar countries that have already overcome comparable challenges. The clustering approach adds scientific credibility and transparency to policy analysis, moving beyond subjective interpretations of readiness. Moreover, the integration of this model into a web-based application demonstrates the practical utility of the research in real-world decision-making contexts.

Ultimately, this work provides a replicable, data-driven framework for evaluating EHR maturity and guiding digital health strategy. It sets the stage for iterative refinement as more data becomes available and as India's healthcare landscape evolves. The insights derived here serve not only to inform national digital health planning but also to contribute to the global discourse on achieving truly interoperable and equitable health information systems.
